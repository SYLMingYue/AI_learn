# AI_learn

In this repository, I will share my AI learning experience, Just starting from CNN.

## preparation
### Using pip and VScode
just install python and VScode, and when install python, remember add python to the environment path, then you can use pip.

### install cuda
By using cuda, we can use GPU to accelerate compute processing. Navigate to [cuda](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) and install correct vision for you NVIDIA GPU. Cuda is optional, we can also use CPU to design neural network.

### install Pytorch for cuda
Torch is a famous deep learning frame, we use Pytorch and compute on Cuda. Just navigate to [torch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and install suitable virsion.
